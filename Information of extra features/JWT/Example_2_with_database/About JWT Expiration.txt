in this example we've kept JWT expiration time as 10 minutes i.e.

.setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 10 * 60 * 1000))

10*60*1000
	comes to 600000 milliseconds  [ 1000 milliseconds=1 second]
i.e. 600 seconds 
i.e. 10 minutes

so, in this example once JWT token gets generated you can send request by passing this token for 10 minutes only. i.e. within 10 minutes you can pass request n number of times , it will work. But after 10 minutes if you pass the request it will give following exception:



io.jsonwebtoken.ExpiredJwtException: JWT expired at 2023-11-21T11:24:00Z. Current time: 2023-11-21T11:25:47Z, a difference of 107693 milliseconds.  Allowed clock skew: 0 milliseconds.
