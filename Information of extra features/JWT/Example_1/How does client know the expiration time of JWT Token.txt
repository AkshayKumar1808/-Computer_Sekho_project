after calling api for /token

you get JWT Token

e.g.

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJzY290dCIsImlhdCI6MTcwMDU3MjkwMiwiZXhwIjoxNzAwNTczNTAyfQ.S-kx1yw4LXqVYW_esRbc8LGQw7eqONvPwuOv_oc6NMk

now copy this and paste it to 
	jwt.io  "Encoded" section and observe 

	PAYLOAD DATA
		exp
		you will find some big number, just place the mouse pointer on that and you will come to know the expiration time
e.g.
at 6:51  you got the JWT token and in the "exp" section when you place mouse pointer it shows:
	19:01:42
notice here "19:01" i.e. at 6:51 you got the token and expiry shows at 19:01 that means token is valid only for 10 minutes.
